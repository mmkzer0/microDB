    - db objects, tables, rows and columns
    - creation/dropping
    - inserting and returning single values
    - returning rows/columns/tables
- basic sql commands
    - SELECT, FROM, WHERE
    - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- serialization into files for persistency
    - serialize, deserialize
- parsing
- ideally dynamic datastructure resizing
